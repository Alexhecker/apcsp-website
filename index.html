    <h2>Mini Bio</h2>
    <p>    I am a novice computer science student who is trying to improve my knowledge revolving around this field. I believe that having a well-rounded knowledge of computer science is a good skill in this evolving digital world. Another reason why I want to learn more about the computer is that my brother in law is the co-founder of the company: Melodrive. With an internship at that company and having a solid foundation, computer science can take me to a brighter future.</p>
